## Basic Informations about the Robot 

### Motors

The TR5 Robotarm uses DC Motors. So they only have 3 States. On, Off or Stop. So to use them we either have to build a H Bridge out of 4 Transistors or buy an DC Motor Controller. My choice fell on the Motor Controller. 

### Positioning of the axis 

The TR5 Robotarm does not use Rotary Encoders or some fancy stuff, it uses Potentiometers on every axis, that means it provides analog feedback.
